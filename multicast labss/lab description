Multicast Lab Description – GNS3 Topology
Lab Objective
This lab demonstrates a basic multicast network configuration using PIM Dense Mode (PIM-DM) for multicast routing, with IGMP for group membership management. The topology shows how multicast traffic is sent from a multicast sender to a multicast receiver client across a routed network using Cisco routers in GNS3.

Topology Overview
The network includes 6 routers (R1–R6) and a Layer 2 switch (Switch1).

The multicast traffic source is R5, sending packets to multicast group 239.1.1.1.

The multicast receiver is R4, configured to join the multicast group 239.1.1.1 using IGMP.

PIM Dense Mode is enabled on all interfaces that are part of the multicast routing path.

OSPF is used as the underlying IGP to establish unicast routing connectivity across the network.

Switch1 is used to connect R4 (receiver) and R6 (another router in the Multicast Server LAN).


Configuration Details R4(Multicast Reciver):
Here I used A router as Multicast Client


interface Gi1/0
 ip address 192.168.3.X 255.255.255.0
 ip igmp join-group 239.1.1.1



R5 (Multicast Source):
ping 239.1.1.1 repeat 1000



Expected Behavior
R4 (Multicast Receiver) should receive multicast packets from R5 (Sender) via the multicast group 239.1.1.1.

PIM-DM will flood multicast traffic initially and prune branches without receivers.

The LHR (R1) and FHR (R2) are responsible for handling multicast group membership and traffic flow.
